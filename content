# Framework7, Next.js & Server-Side Rendering? Yes!



In [Framework7 v6 release announcement](https://blog.framework7.io/framework7-v6-d5b843abe8e7) we mentioned the full server-side rendering support. Now it is time for practice.

## TL;DR

You can fork this [**framework7-nextjs-starter](https://github.com/framework7io/framework7-nextjs-starter)** project right away and start hacking on it.

## Create Next.js Project

First, we need to create a new Next.js project. We will use `create-next-app` CLI tool. Run in terminal:

    npx create-next-app f7-next-app

This command will create a project in a `/f7-next-app` directory.

## Install Framework7

Let’s move to our project directory (`/f7-next-app`) directory and install required Framework7 dependencies. We need to install Framework7 itself, Framework7-React (as we develop a React app), Framework7 and Material icons:

    npm i framework7 framework7-react framework7-icons material-icons

## Setup Environment Variables

In project root folder we need to create two `env` files:

* `.env.development` — with environment variables for development

* `.env.production` — with environment variables for production build

In this files we need to define `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST` variable, that will point to our webapp host. During development it will be `[http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000,) (default Next.js dev server), and for production you need to specify the host where the app will be deployed:

## Routing

Before, we start hacking into our app files, let’s figure out how to handle routing here.

Next.js has an amazing built-in router, but unfortunately it doesn’t fit for complex page transitions used in Framework7. To solve this issues we need to use both Next.js (to get initial page component on server-side) and Framework7 (on client-side) routers.

To support server-side routing and have a correct response with initially requested page we must keep our pages in structure required by Next.js (e.g. in `./pages` folder). And we need to match our Framework7 router to this pages.

For example, if we have the following pages in our Next.js app:

* `./pages/index.js`

* `./pages/about.js`

* `./pages/blog/[postID].js` — dynamic route

We need to match it to Framework7 React router and pass this routes to our Framework7 App. So Framework7 routes for such structure will be the following:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/e5a70b4ff33b5667b6047f374ba86900" frameborder=0></iframe>

Pay attention that we use `asyncComponent` because we don’t want (and more likely don’t need) to add all routes/pages content into initial page JavaScript file.

## _app.js

Now, let’s move to our main app component. We need to setup and tweak our main App layout in `pages/_app.js` file. By default (created by `create-next-app`) it should look like this:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/f5bddc8788738b80762ce749cddb8732" frameborder=0></iframe>

Let’s modify it to the following:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/17f423432b4a3ff28c0b462235ae7c40" frameborder=0></iframe>

## index.js

We are almost ready. What is left is to change our main index page (located in `index.js` ) to be a Framework7-React page:

## Launch 🚀

Now, let’s launch our dev server

    npm run dev

And we should see something similar to this on `http://localhost:3000`

But was it rendered on server-side? Let’s check response source code:

Great, as we see server-side rendering works.

## Navigation

As mentioned above for navigating and router we use ONLY Framework7’s router, its methods and components.

Let’s create dynamic route page in `./pages/blog/[postID].js` file with the following content:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/da240d1d0a711db3e8e3b73c0339d017" frameborder=0></iframe>

And now we need to add this route to our Framework7 routes in `_app.js` :

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/1574292636e5f0e3be802487d9529ec2" frameborder=0></iframe>

And link to the page, somewhere on our home page:

    <a href="/blog/45">Blog post</a>

Everything works as intended:

## Bonus: Server-Side Theme Detection

As you may know Framework7 supports iOS, Material Design and Aurora themes. Theme can be specified on main App component like so:

    <App theme="ios">

Or it can be set to `auto` and Framework7 will decide which theme to use based on user device. And if we use server-side rendering, it is not recommended to use `auto` theme senselessly.

For example, we set theme to `auto`, and user visits our web app with iOS device. Framework7 will be initialized on server-side, and apparently it will not detect server environment as iOS device and will enable `material` theme. Then on client side, it will detect it as iOS device and set theme to `ios` , but HTML layout rendered on server-side can be different (the one that required for `material` theme), which can produce as server-client layouts will not match.

Simple solution will be to just use single theme. But that is not for us. With Next.js `getInitialProps` we can actually correctly detect user’s device on server-side based on his `user-agent` !

To do so, let’s add `getInitialProps` function to our `_app.js` and see how get and use user-agent:

<iframe src="https://medium.com/media/493e3bdf17b0986bb8f48f5aa6413d11" frameborder=0></iframe>

Now, theme detection will work correctly and we can safely use condition rendering even on server-side, e.g.:
