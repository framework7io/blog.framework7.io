# Framework7 4.4.0 — Treeview

I am glad to introduce new 4.4.0 Framework7 update with lots of new features and improvements.

## All New Treeview Component

This was asked for a while, and it is finally here. All new Treeview component, which will be a great improvement for desktop apps.

## Checkboxes With Indeterminate State

Simple but very useful Checkboxes UI improvement with new indeterminate state, which fits great when used in Treeview or in Data Tables:

## Swipe To Close Popup

One more requested feature — is the ability to close Popups with swipes. Now it is here:

## Swipeable Sheet Modals

This was asked a lot from Framework7 community. Sheet modals now can be also closed with swipe. But more important, there is a new “swipe-to-step” functionality, which is used a lot in native apps. When it is enabled, sheet modal will be opened for some specific size that later can be further expanded with swipe gesture:

## Autcomplete with Keyboard

Autocomplete got few desktop improvements.

Now, it is possible to select autocomplete dropdown value with keyboard UP and DOWN keys and confirm selection with ENTER — which is pretty straightforward behavior for desktop apps. Also, dropdown will be closed with keyboard ESC key:
